### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Hassan**](https://hassannaveed.com), a technical consultant from Toronto, Canada.

I currently work as a technical consultant at [**@SonarSoftware**](https://github.com/sonarsoftwareinc), where I serve as the primary technical liaison between clients and the Sonar team, advising on best practices and ensuring efficient communication to enhance client experience and satisfaction. Previously, I was at [**@Oracle**](https://github.com/oracle) and [**@A3logics**](https://www.a3logics.com/).

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play video games, sports and like to garden during my downtime.
